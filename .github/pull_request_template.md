### What and why
<!-- What problem does this solve? Link the issue/story. -->
<!-- If this is a visual change, explain the before/after behaviour, not just "updated the button". -->

[RHCLOUD-XXXXX](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHCLOUD-XXXXX)

---

### Screenshots
<!-- Required for any visible UI change. Before and after. -->
<!-- A link to the relevant Storybook story works as well, and is often better — it lets reviewers interact with the component. -->
<!-- Skip this section only for pure logic / non-visual changes. -->

---

### Anything non-obvious reviewers should know?
<!-- Intentional trade-offs, known limitations, things that look wrong but are right. -->
<!-- If you had to think about something twice, write it here. -->

### Attention needed
- [ ] _(Optional) QE: notable impact on test coverage or OUIA IDs changed_
- [ ] _(Optional) UX: end-user UX modified, designs may need sign-off_
