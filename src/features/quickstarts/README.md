# quickstarts

Thin wrapper that integrates the Red Hat Console quickstarts system into RBAC UI. Renders quickstart content (guided in-app tutorials) for IAM/RBAC topics.

No custom business logic — this island exists purely to mount the quickstarts panel at the appropriate route. See the Red Hat Console quickstarts library for the underlying implementation.
